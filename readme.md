# Mapbox Track Block

## About

Add maps from your GPX files to your posts and pages. 

This block allows you to upload a GPX file to the media library and display it on a Mapbox map. You can change the map style, track thickness, colour and zoom.

## Usage

- You need a Mapbox account and access token which you can get at https://mapbox.com (they have a very generous free tier)
- Download the plugin from releases and upload it to your WordPress site.
- Add your access token in the options page
- Add the block to your post or page and the rest should be pretty intuitive

## Known Issues / Limitations

- This is still a work in progress
- Only one map to be displayed per page or post
- Large track files might cause some performance issues as the track data is loaded from a script in the DOM on the frontend.
- Some GPX files with multiple tracks may not render.
